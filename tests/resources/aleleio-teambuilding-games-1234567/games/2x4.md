## Description
Eight members stand in a line, shoulder to shoulder with men and women alternating. The task will be successfully completed when on one side of the line there are only women and on the other only men.

The following rules will be applied:
 as few changes as possible
 all changes have to be in pairs (a pair: two people standing next to each other: man/woman, woman/woman,
man/man.)
 when a pair changes, their space becomes free and can be filled by another pair.
 the pair can not change their order while they move around
 at the end, there are no free spaces allowed

The easiest solution is:
1.) mwmwmwmw
2.) m- - mwmwwm 3.) mmww - - mwwm 4.) mmwwwwm - - m

## Description
1. Use numbers 1 and two instead of men and woman if needed
