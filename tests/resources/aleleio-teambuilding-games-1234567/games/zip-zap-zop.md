# Zip Zap Zop

## Description
Someone begins by pointing the player to his/her side and says 'zip'. That player turns to the next player in the circle, points to them and says 'zip'. Thus the 'zip' zips around the circle in one direction. At any time a receiving player can say 'zap' to the person pointing at them. When they do the player that said 'zip' and was pointing at them must change direction of the pointing. This means that they must quickly turn around, point and say 'zip' to the person that just pointed at them. Now the 'zip' can zip around the circle, but changing direction every time there is a 'zap'. Lastly the person that receives the 'zip' may elect to yell 'zop' and point at someone anywhere in the circle. That player then restarts the 'zip' going in the direction of their choice.

## Description
You can play the game in the style of the 80s Arcade beat-em-up "Street Fighter". Zip then becomes "Tiger Uppercut!" together with an upwards fist punch, Zap becomes "Hadouken!" which looks at bit like Dragonball's "KameHameHa!" (google it ;) and Zop becomes "Sonic Boom!"

Additionally, you can add a blocking motion ("Shield") to the game.
