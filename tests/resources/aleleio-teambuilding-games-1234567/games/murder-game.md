# Murder Game

## Description
This game has two rounds. The group sits in a circle with eyes closed. The
facilitator tells the group that he will now select a murderer by tipping this very person on the shoulder. But the facilitator is not tipping anyone on the shoulder! They now have to look around in the circle and observe each member for 2 minutes in order to decide according to the behaviour of each member who they want to accuse being the murderer. They are not allowed to talk. After two minutes they have to point at the person who they think is the murderer. Then they have to close their eyes again. This time the facilitator tips everyone on the shoulder. Then same procedure. Ask the members how different they have felt in both rounds and what they have observed.
