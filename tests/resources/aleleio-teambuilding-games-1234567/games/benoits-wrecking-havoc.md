prior_prep: "Before the game starts, you should prepare a big pile of material in the middle of the area that everyone can easily access. Emphasise the fact that the material is for common use.

If done with paint:

EVERYONE SHOULD BE WEARING OLD CLOTHES THAT CAN EASILY BE RUINED
MAKE SURE THE AREA IS EASY TO CLEAN
MAKE SURE TO USE GOUACHE PAINT OR FINGERPAINT: NEVER ACRYLICS OR OIL PAINT. This is important because of how tedious these last two are to clean up.
Make sure the delegates will have time to shower after.
Make sure there will be enough time to clean up after.

Best done outside, in summer."

# Benoit's Wrecking Havoc

## Description
This is best done at the end of a very intense day. Split the delegates into teams and give each of them a shoebox. In one big pile, put all the remaining material.

Have the delegates destroy the shoeboxes. Let them go wild. Next, tell them that the aim now is that they each come up with an artwork that represents their team. By the end of the game, there must not be a single piece of box lying on the ground.

If it goes well, at the end of the game the delegates can present their artwork.

## Description
The more material the better. Or add paint: more fun, more creativity. Count at least 3h extra to clean up the mess.
