# 3 Noses

## Description
Have the group begin to wander around the room. When the leader calls out a command like three left elbows then as quick as you can, players should gather in groups of three with left elbows touching. Next do four butt cheeks, two right feet etc. etc. End with three noses and/or four belly buttons.
